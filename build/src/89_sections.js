/* ==========================================================================
   NUMBERING — the contents address of every scene, and its textbook anchor.

   Two independent things live here, and they answer different questions.

   The address (`sec`) says where a scene sits in this course: chapter, section,
   scene. The chapters are the ones the lecture notes already carry, so the
   artifact and the notes name the same material the same way.

   The anchor (`book`) says where the same material is developed at length in
   the course textbook. It is a reference and nothing more: no title, no
   sentence and no figure is taken from there.

   Both are declared once, here, and derived onto the scene objects at load
   time by `applyNumbering`. No scene file carries either field, so a
   renumbering is an edit to this file alone.

   The two numbering systems do not agree, and in one place they disagree
   dangerously: this course's chapter 10 is information theory, and the
   textbook's chapter 10 is transmission through bandlimited channels. A reader
   who follows a bare "CH10" into the book lands somewhere unrelated. The mark
   in `CONTENT.BOOKMARK` is what keeps the two apart on the page, and it is not
   optional in any surface.

   opening, the concept map, the closing material — is simply absent from this
   table and renders no anchor. */

   the contents surfaces render from. Addresses are computed rather than
   written down twice, so a section that gains a scene renumbers by itself and
   cannot drift out of step with the declaration.

   Three id shapes take a space of their own rather than an ordinal, because
   they are not teaching scenes: a laboratory (`*-lab-*`) takes `L`, and the
   two question scenes of a module take `Q1` and `Q2`. Each counts from 1
